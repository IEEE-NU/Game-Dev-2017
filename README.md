```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

1. Download the project files to your computer using either browser or bash

```
git clone https://github.com/IEEE-NU/Game-Dev-2017
```
2. Open unity and run StartMenu.unity in the scenes folder

### Gameplay Instructions
Launch the game from the StartMenu scene. Once the game has started, use the right and left arrow keys to control the direction the ship is faceing. Press the 'Q', 'W', 'E', or 'R' keys to apply varying amounts of thrust to the ship. Applying thrust will also shoot projectiles out of the back of the ship. Press "Space" to shoot a laser beam from the front of the ship. The laser beam will push asteroids away. Stop the asteroids from hitting the earth for as long as you can!
